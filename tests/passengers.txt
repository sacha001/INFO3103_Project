Do these tests AFTER doing the "rides" tests


#1
# Add yourself to a ride (in this case, zsmith1's ride id=2)

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -b cookie-jar -k https://info3103.cs.unb.ca:<your port>/rides/zsmith1/2/passengers


#2
# Get the passengers for this ride
# There should only be the one you just added

curl -X GET -b cookie-jar -k https://info3103.cs.unb.ca:<your port>/rides/zsmith1/2/passengers


#3
# Get your passenger for this ride
# This should also just return your user but not as an array this time

curl -X GET -b cookie-jar -k https://info3103.cs.unb.ca:<your port>/rides/zsmith1/2/passengers/<your username>


#4
# Delete your passenger from this ride
# This should remove your passenger from the ride, you can run the previous command to make sure it worked

curl -X DELETE -b cookie-jar -k https://info3103.cs.unb.ca:<your port>/rides/zsmith1/2/passengers/<your username>
